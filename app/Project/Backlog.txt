-- Core
[x] Make a seperate component and model for Values, values should have a stable id so logs
    across sessoions can properly reference them
        [x] Make component for ValueHeader

[x] Save logs locally
    // How am I going to store the comments? One way is to just store in local storage as commentsForValueId and just have that be an array. Eventually I can store in pages of 10, but for now it is find to
    just store these as {valueID : [CommentItem]}
[] Add timestamps to logs
[] Add delete button (comments need ID for this)
[] Only show 10 logs at a time and allow asking for 10 more

-- UX
[] Make it so comments are collapsed by default, 1 section has comments at a time


-- Firebase
[] Add firebase auth
[] Store comments in firebase
